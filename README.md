# SequenceSolver
#### A simple program to solve a specaial sequence. ####

### How to use the program ###
If you have a set of numbers and a target number these can be stored under these variables:
target = \Your target number\
numbers = [] (an array for the numbers)

The program does the rest.

### How it works ###
This program takes a sequnce of numbers and when given a target number, solves the equation.

For example:

If the sequence is: [2,6,9,5,3] and the target is 48:
    this could be written as:
    2 ? 6 ? 9 ? 5 ? 3 = 48 (where the question marks represent missing operators)

The program uses an algorithm to find the missing operators and displays the equation as:
(This is the solution to above)
2 X 6 + 9 - 5 * 3 = 48

### REMIX Tips ###
+ To add a user interactivity - Allow the user to enter the target number and sequence as inputs rather from the source code
+ To find a way to display the algorithm steps taken to reach the solution (print statements carefully placed in the functions)
+ Maybe a GUI??
